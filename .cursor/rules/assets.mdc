# Assets

The assets directory contains any assets that need to be referenced within a `.liquid` file, usually using the [asset_url](mdc:https:/shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/filters/asset_url) Liquid filter.

Assets is a flat directory, it may not contain subdirectories.

Any images that are required in the code, including icons, may be stored within assets.  Icons can be used in `.liquid` files via the [inline_asset_content](mdc:https:/shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/filters/inline_asset_content) Liquid filter.
